# KartoshkaMusic

Music player for spotify that displays album art in a cool way.

Also will allow playlists with chained songs


Ideas:

grey song progess bar fills up

hover over album to enlarge and get info

click mini album to remove from queue?

When playing multiple songs from one album consecutively, add number to mini album to indicate how many have already played. hovering over shows which songs in what order

# Known Problems

album art too big for small screen

pause icon not central

background band photo needs height to be increased to 100% of main section
