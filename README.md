# KartoshkaMusic

Music player for spotify that displays album art in a cool way.

Also will allow playlists with chained songs


Ideas:

grey song progess bar fills up

hover over album to enlarge and get info

click mini album to remove from queue?

# Known Problems

album art too big for small screen

pause icon not central

background band photo needs height to be increased to 100% of main section

when no song playing, page will constantly refresh
